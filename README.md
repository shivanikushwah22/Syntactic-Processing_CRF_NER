  In this assignment, you need to perform the following broad steps:
  
  -we need to process and modify the data into sentence format. This step has to be done for the 'train_sent' and ‘train_label’ datasets and for test datasets as well.
  
  -After that, we need to define the features to build the CRF model.
  
  -Then, we need to apply these features in each sentence of the train and the test dataset to get the feature values.
  
  -Once the features are computed, we need to define the target variable and then build the CRF model.
  
  -Then, we need to perform the evaluation using a test data set.
  
  -After that, we need to create a dictionary in which diseases are keys and treatments are values.

- **What is the dataset that is being used?**
  
  -train_sent
